Assignment 2019 - Machine Learning and Statistics

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the assignment for the Machine Learning and Statistics module. It is divided into three sections:

    Descriptive Statistics : Descriptive statistics are used to investigate house prices in the Boston Houe Price dataset.
    Inferential Statistics : I use a Mannâ€“Whitney U test to infer if there is a difference in house prices based on the proximity to the Charles River.
    Neural Network : I make a Neural Network to predict house prices based on 13 other variables. I pre-process the data to improve accuracy.
    

I would suggest that you run the notebook from top to bottom in order. If you encounter any problems:

    Run the cell immediately above - there may be a return needed from here to run your current cell.
    If that fails, go back to the top of the notebook and run the cell which imports the libraries required.
    Finally, you may have to close the notebook, kill jupyter notebook on the command line and restart it.
